    <b>Background</b>: Sleep is essential to life. Accurate measurement and classification of sleep/wake and sleep stages is important in clinical studies for sleep disorder diagnoses and in the interpretation of data from consumer devices for monitoring physical and mental well-being. Existing non-polysomnography sleep classification techniques mainly rely on heuristic methods developed in relatively small cohorts. Thus, we aimed to establish the accuracy of wrist-worn accelerometers for sleep stage classification and subsequently describe the association between sleep duration and efficiency (proportion of total time asleep when in bed) with mortality outcomes. 
    
    <br /><br />
    <b>Methods</b>: We developed and validated a self-supervised deep neural network for sleep stage classification using concurrent laboratory-based polysomnography and accelerometry data from three countries (Australia, the UK, and the USA). The model was validated within-cohort using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation for sleep-wake classification and in a three-class setting for sleep stage classification {wake, rapid-eye-movement sleep (REM), non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREM)} and by external validation. We assessed the face validity of our model for population inference by applying the model to the UK Biobank with ~100,000 participants, each of whom wore a wristband for up to seven days. The derived sleep parameters were used in a Cox regression model to study the association of sleep duration and sleep efficiency with all-cause mortality.

    <br /><br />
    <b>Findings</b>: After exclusion, 1,448 participant nights of data were used to train the sleep classifier. The difference between polysomnography and the model classifications on the external validation was 34.7 minutes (95% limits of agreement (LoA):  -37.8 to 107.2 minutes) for total sleep duration, 2.6 minutes for REM duration (95% LoA:  -68.4 to 73.4 minutes) and 32.1 minutes (95% LoA:  -54.4 to 118.5 minutes) for NREM duration. The derived sleep architecture estimate in the UK Biobank sample showed good face validity. Among 66,214 UK Biobank participants, 1,642 mortality events were observed. Short sleepers (&lt;6 hours) had a higher risk of mortality compared to participants with normal sleep duration (6 to 7.9 hours), regardless of whether they had low sleep efficiency (Hazard ratios (HRs): 1.69; 95% confidence intervals (CIs): 1.28 to 2.24 ) or high sleep efficiency (HRs: 1.42; 95% CIs: 1.14  to 1.77).
    
    <br /><br />
    <b>Interpretation</b>: Deep-learning-based sleep classification using accelerometers has a fair to moderate agreement with polysomnography. Our findings suggest that having short overnight sleep confers mortality risk irrespective of sleep continuity.
